# License Plate 2020: A New Database to Benchmark License Plate Detection and Recognition
By Hsu, Gee-Sern and Chung, Sheng-Luen and Moritz Sontheimer and Yang, Chao-Hsu

LP-2020 database can be used in two ways: either used to train and test a developed algorithm or used for the verification of an existing trained algorithm, where the algorithm refers to LPD, LPR, or jointly as LPDR algorithm. The samples were split equally 50%/50% into a  training set with validation included and a test set with balanced variations in attributes. As a result, both training set and testing set have 3,552 images each, with 12,988 and 12,722 license plates, respectively. There are 4,634 readable and 8,354 unreadable license plates in the training set,and 4,457 readable and 8,265 unreadable in the testing set. We also provide the training set for LPR with collaging and cycleGAN,each has 10,000 synthesized license plate images.

Here are some examples from the dataset.
